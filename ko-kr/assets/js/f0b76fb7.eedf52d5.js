That\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced a new royalty model where you only pay a reasonable royalty after your project begins to generate meaningful revenue.\\n\\nAs of April 5, 2025, if your project using Joint earns more than $15,000 USD in annual gross revenue, a 1% royalty fee will apply only to the portion exceeding that amount.\\n\\nRoyalty thresholds and percentages may change with future license revisions. However, to ensure both your rights and project stability, we are committed to enforcing clear limitations on such changes, including:\\n\\n - Changes to the royalty percentage or royalty threshold must be announced at least two (2) months in advance. The Licensor must notify users via the official Discord and GitHub repository.\\n\\n - During this period, the Licensor shall engage in discussions with users to address concerns and adjustments regarding the changes. However, the final decision remains at the discretion of the Licensor.\\n\\n - When increasing the royalty percentage, the Licensor must raise it by no more than 0.5% every six months, based on a mid-year division around June 30. Under no circumstances shall the royalty percentage exceed a maximum cap of 3%.\\n\\n - There are no specific limitations on changes to the royalty threshold, but the threshold shall not be set below $10,000 USD under any circumstances.\\n\\nFor educational and non-commercial research purposes, royalties may be waived only with prior written approval from the Licensor.\\n\\nAdditionally, individuals or organizations that officially purchased Joint via Fab or Unreal Marketplace before April 13, 2025, may be eligible for exemptions or discounts under this royalty program depending on the purchase date and license terms.\\n\\n#### Contribute and Support Our Projects \u2013 Earn Rewards!\\n\\nWe plan to offer substantial royalty discounts to users who provide meaningful support \u2013 whether technical, financial, business, or promotional.\\n\\nBecause such contributions are difficult to quantify strictly, we cannot present a fixed benefits table. However, we can say with confidence that contributions, especially in the form of promotion or business partnerships, are extremely valuable to our team. In return, we plan to provide aggressive rewards for those who support us.\\n\\nDepending on the nature and scale of your contributions, you may receive:\\n\\n - 10\u201350% or more royalty discounts (From the final royalty. For example, if you have to pay 100 USD as royalty, 10% discounts will lower it to be 90 USD)\\n\\n - Priority technical support\\n\\n - Public promotion of your project via our official GitHub, website, and Discord\\n\\n#### Build and Monetize Your Own Derivative Software with Joint!\\n\\nGot a brilliant idea for a plugin or tool based on Joint \u2013 like Joint Native or our secret upcoming project Joint Yggdrasil?\\n\\nYou are welcome to build and monetize your own Derivative Software based on Joint.
