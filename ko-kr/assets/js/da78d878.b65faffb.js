As a solo developer with very limited resources, I tried to maintain high standards for promotional materials, but that left me with little time or capacity to actually showcase the project publicly.\\n\\nAlthough the system was a much more advanced and modular playback framework, I initially positioned it as just a dialogue system - something that affected how it was perceived. After spending years refining both the system and its ecosystem, I eventually hit a wall - both financially and emotionally. During that difficult time, I made some rushed decisions, like changing the pricing model abruptly, only to reverse them later.\\n\\nIt was in that state that I applied for the Epic MegaGrant - thinking of it as a last shot. Thankfully, Joint received a MegaGrant. and we now have the financial support we need. As I look to the future, I\u2019m encouraged and have a renewed sense of purpose to keep going.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re an indie dev like me - maybe struggling with a great tool or idea that hasn\u2019t found its market - please consider applying for an Epic MegaGrant.\\n\\n**What\u2019s Next After Receiving an Epic MegaGrant?**\\n\\nThe entire MegaGrant will be used to further improve the product. I hope to either hire someone or find passionate contributors who believe in this project.\\n\\nHere are just a few of the development goals currently on the roadmap:\\n\\n**Joint Native:**\\n\\n+ **Full MetaHuman Support** We aim to make it extremely easy to integrate expressive narrative animations and voice systems with MetaHuman-based skeletal meshes - so that rich, dynamic characters can be used directly in the Joint Native dialogue framework.\\n\\n+ **Writer-Friendly Tools** We\u2019re working on tools that allow writers to edit Joint scripts outside of Unreal Engine, through a standalone editor. The goal is to allow story designers and writers to work without needing to install Unreal Engine at all - while still syncing seamlessly with Unreal projects.\\n\\nThere are many more features in development, but most of them aren\u2019t quite ready to be announced publicly yet. I appreciate your understanding.\\n\\n**A Small Call for Help**\\n-------------------------\\n\\nWe\'re actively looking for developers and promoters who might be interested in contributing to the project. Since Joint is open-source and free for most users, we unfortunately can\u2019t offer large financial incentives - at least, not beyond what\u2019s available from the MegaGrant.\\n\\nBut if you\'re someone who loves meaningful, technically challenging projects, and wants to help shape a unique tool with potential to benefit many creators, we\u2019d absolutely love to work with you.\\n\\nFeel free to reach out: **devgrain13@gmail.com**\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\\\- DevGrain"}]}}')}}]);
