<p>Today, we're sharing the biggest change on Joint! <strong>Now Joint's content is provided on GitHub as an open source project!</strong></p>

<p>You are free to install and use Joint without paying any fees – use it as you wish in your project, in any direction you choose!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-the-new-joint-royalty-licensing">Introducing the New Joint Royalty Licensing<a href="https://gggrain.github.io/Unreal-Joint-Documentation/ko-kr/blog/Joint%20has%20become%20an%20open%20source%20project!#introducing-the-new-joint-royalty-licensing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Introducing the New Joint Royalty Licensing에 대한 직접 링크" title="Introducing the New Joint Royalty Licensing에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4>
<p>We aim to empower indie and small-scale developers to use Joint in a practical and proactive way, without financial pressure. That’s why we’ve introduced a new royalty model where you only pay a reasonable royalty after your project begins to generate meaningful revenue.</p>
<p>As of April 5, 2025, if your project using Joint earns more than $15,000 USD in annual gross revenue, a 1% royalty fee will apply only to the portion exceeding that amount.</p>
<p>Royalty thresholds and percentages may change with future license revisions. However, to ensure both your rights and project stability, we are committed to enforcing clear limitations on such changes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changes to the royalty percentage or royalty threshold must be announced at least two (2) months in advance. The Licensor must notify users via the official Discord and GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During this period, the Licensor shall engage in discussions with users to address concerns and adjustments regarding the changes. However, the final decision remains at the discretion of the Licensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When increasing the royalty percentage, the Licensor must raise it by no more than 0.5% every six months, based on a mid-year division around June 30. Under no circumstances shall the royalty percentage exceed a maximum cap of 3%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no specific limitations on changes to the royalty threshold, but the threshold shall not be set below $10,000 USD under any circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For educational and non-commercial research purposes, royalties may be waived only with prior written approval from the Licensor.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals or organizations that officially purchased Joint via Fab or Unreal Marketplace before April 13, 2025, may be eligible for exemptions or discounts under this royalty program depending on the purchase date and license terms.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contribute-and-support-our-projects--earn-rewards">Contribute and Support Our Projects – Earn Rewards!<a href="https://gggrain.github.io/Unreal-Joint-Documentation/ko-kr/blog/Joint%20has%20become%20an%20open%20source%20project!#contribute-and-support-our-projects--earn-rewards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Contribute and Support Our Projects – Earn Rewards!에 대한 직접 링크" title="Contribute and Support Our Projects – Earn Rewards!에 대한 직접 링크">​</a></h4>
<p>We plan to offer substantial royalty discounts to users who provide meaningful support – whether technical, financial, business, or promotional.</p>
<p>Because such contributions are difficult to quantify strictly, we cannot present a fixed benefits table. However, we can say with confidence that contributions, especially in the form of promotion or business partnerships, are extremely valuable to our team. In return, we plan to provide aggressive rewards for those who support us.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature and scale of your contributions, you may receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>10–50% or more royalty discounts (From the final royalty. For example, if you have to pay 100 USD as royalty, 10% discounts will lower it to be 90 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priority technical support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public promotion of your project via our official GitHub, website, and Discord</p>
</li>
</ul>
