<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-is-joint"><strong>What Is Joint?</strong><a href="https://gggrain.github.io/Unreal-Joint-Documentation/blog/Joint%20&amp;%20Its%20ecosystem%20have%20received%20an%20Epic%20MegaGrant#what-is-joint" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-joint" title="Direct link to what-is-joint" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Joint Ecosystem</strong> refers to the products that are powered by Joint, a modular gameplay playback framework where you can declare, combine, stack nodes to create dynamic and responsive gameplay production.</p>
<p>One of the core products of its ecosystem, <strong>Joint Native,</strong> provides an ability to easily build up and manage very complex narrative &amp; dialogue production that meets the needs of AAA game studios with Joint’s modular playback design.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/inTDwlB_BkQ?si=wz2RQPHEdapvQsQB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Joint Short Showcase</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWzKk1lRJZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Joint - Unreal Engine Modular Dialogue System</a></p>
<p>(Please understand that it’s an old showcase video and introduces Joint itself as a dialogue system - which is certainly much more than that as I told above!!)</p>
<p><strong>What an Epic MegaGrant will do for Joint</strong></p>
<p>Joint was a solid and well-performing project, but due to financial and practical limitations, it remained almost completely unknown. As a solo developer with very limited resources, I tried to maintain high standards for promotional materials, but that left me with little time or capacity to actually showcase the project publicly.</p>
<p>Although the system was a much more advanced and modular playback framework, I initially positioned it as just a dialogue system - something that affected how it was perceived. After spending years refining both the system and its ecosystem, I eventually hit a wall - both financially and emotionally. During that difficult time, I made some rushed decisions, like changing the pricing model abruptly, only to reverse them later.</p>
<p>It was in that state that I applied for the Epic MegaGrant - thinking of it as a last shot. Thankfully, Joint received a MegaGrant. and we now have the financial support we need. As I look to the future, I’m encouraged and have a renewed sense of purpose to keep going.</p>
<p>If you’re an indie dev like me - maybe struggling with a great tool or idea that hasn’t found its market - please consider applying for an Epic MegaGrant.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next After Receiving an Epic MegaGrant?</strong></p>
<p>The entire MegaGrant will be used to further improve the product. I hope to either hire someone or find passionate contributors who believe in this project.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the development goals currently on the roadmap:</p>
<p><strong>Joint Native:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Full MetaHuman Support</strong> We aim to make it extremely easy to integrate expressive narrative animations and voice systems with MetaHuman-based skeletal meshes - so that rich, dynamic characters can be used directly in the Joint Native dialogue framework.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Writer-Friendly Tools</strong> We’re working on tools that allow writers to edit Joint scripts outside of Unreal Engine, through a standalone editor. The goal is to allow story designers and writers to work without needing to install Unreal Engine at all - while still syncing seamlessly with Unreal projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more features in development, but most of them aren’t quite ready to be announced publicly yet. I appreciate your understanding.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="a-small-call-for-help"><strong>A Small Call for Help</strong><a href="https://gggrain.github.io/Unreal-Joint-Documentation/blog/Joint%20&amp;%20Its%20ecosystem%20have%20received%20an%20Epic%20MegaGrant#a-small-call-for-help" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to a-small-call-for-help" title="Direct link to a-small-call-for-help" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We're actively looking for developers and promoters who might be interested in contributing to the project. Since Joint is open-source and free for most users, we unfortunately can’t offer large financial incentives - at least, not beyond what’s available from the MegaGrant.</p>
<p>But if you're someone who loves meaningful, technically challenging projects, and wants to help shape a unique tool with potential to benefit many creators, we’d absolutely love to work with you.</p>
